# Electric Vehicle Prediction

</div>

## Project Structure
The current project is the form of a simple Jupyter Notebook
GitHub can display Jupyter Notebooks as of 2022.

You can read the Jupyter Notebook directly or 
just browser through this README to get a gist of the problem statement and solutions provided.

## Problem Statement
The aim of this project is to predict the cost of a electric vehicle.
The features include(non-exhaustive)
- Buyers Address
- The make and model of the vehicle
- The electric grid provider

The data is not clean and but available to download on Kaggle.

## Approach
Multiple models and algorithms were tried , but only after extensive data processing.

This includes Encoding , Imputing and normalizing the dataset.

## Code

See [this](./electric-vehicle.ipynb) for information
